this is a totally reimplemention of sam voice synthesis. inspired by sam.

refï¼šhttps://github.com/s-macke/SAM


the difference with SAM:
1. the code is totally reimplemention
2. the voice data is from espeak-ng, so could support more language
3. the code size is limited to <64k in bin executable, so that it could port to other chip easily.
